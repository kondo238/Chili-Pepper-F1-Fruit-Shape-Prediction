# NOTE
・This repositry shared dataset and Rscripts to perform PPδ, a phenomic prediction methods to estimate fruit shapes of F1 progenies in chili peppers (Capsicum annuum).

・PPδ enables predictions of fruit contours in F1 progenies of chili peppers based on the parental EFDs.

・The detailed concepts were written in our papper (Kondo et al. unpublised).
